## Food Truck Project

## Week 2 Homework for Skill Distillery

My week 2 project in Skill Distillery. This was a project that i needed to make a Food Truck app that prompt the user to make several options to enter. The use gets prompt to enter up to five food trucks along with the name, food type, and rating. Then after all inputs were entered, i made a menu to show the options given and and make methods to get the list of trucks, average rating, highest rating, and a quit.


## Lessons learned
The lessons learned was for me was trying to setup arrays and having them get used when in the methods. I also forget to put int when making a for loop and mistakingly used commas instead of brackets for arrays. I also learned more about setting up for loops along with the if statements by using the car and car tester for reference.
